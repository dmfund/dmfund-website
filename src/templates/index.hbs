        <h4>Our Approach</h4>
        <h2>How We Partner with Entrepreneurs</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>We believe the best businesses are built by operators with deep industry knowledge, a bias for action, and the drive to lead. We provide the capital, mentorship, and long-term commitment they need.</p>

          <div class="philosophy-card__number">01</div>
          <h3>Search &amp; Acquisition</h3>
          <p>We back talented entrepreneurs in their search for the right business to acquire. From refining the thesis to closing the deal, we are a hands-on partner at every stage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="philosophy-card fade-up delay-2">
          <div class="philosophy-card__number">02</div>
          <h3>Operational Partnership</h3>
          <p>Post-acquisition, we work alongside our CEOs as engaged board members and strategic advisors. We bring pattern recognition from across our portfolio without imposing a playbook.</p>
        </div>

          <h4>Our Story</h4>
          <h2>Built on Relationships,<br>Driven by Purpose</h2>
          <div class="divider"></div>
          <p>Davis/Macleod was founded on the belief that the search fund model represents one of the most compelling paths to entrepreneurship and value creation in the lower middle market.</p>
          <p class="mt-4">As a family investment office, we bring more than capital to the table. We bring decades of operational experience, a network of trusted advisors and operators, and the patience that comes from investing our own money alongside our partners.</p>
