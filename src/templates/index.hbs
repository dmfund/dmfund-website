        <h2>How We Partner with Entrepreneurs</h2>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>We believe the best businesses are built by operators with deep industry knowledge, a bias for action, and the drive to lead. We provide the capital, mentorship, and long-term commitment they need.</p>

          <div class="philosophy-card__number">01</div>
          <h3>Search &amp; Acquisition</h3>
          <p>We back talented entrepreneurs in their search for the right business to acquire. From refining the thesis to closing the deal, we are a hands-on partner at every stage.</p>
        </div>

          <div class="philosophy-card__number">02</div>
          <h3>Operational Partnership</h3>
          <p>Post-acquisition, we work alongside our CEOs as engaged board members and strategic advisors. We bring pattern recognition from across our portfolio without imposing a playbook.</p>

          <div class="philosophy-card__number">03</div>
          <h3>Long-Term Stewardship</h3>
          <p>We invest with a permanent ownership mindset. Our family capital allows us to hold businesses indefinitely, aligning our incentives with the desires of the entrepreneurs we work with.</p>

          <p>Davis/Macleod was founded on a simple belief: the search fund model is one of the most compelling paths to entrepreneurship and long-term value creation in the lower middle market.</p>
          <p class="mt-4">As a family investment office, we invest our own capital alongside a select group of likeminded partners. We are not constrained by short fund cycles or institutional mandates, which allows us to focus on long-term value creation and support entrepreneurs through the full arc of ownership.</p>
          <p class="mt-4">We bring more than capital. We bring an operator's perspective, a network of trusted advisors, and a partnership built on alignment, trust, and shared outcomes.</p>
